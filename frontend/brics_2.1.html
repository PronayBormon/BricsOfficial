                            <h3>What Does South Africa Stand to Gain from an Expanded BRICS?</h3>

                            <p>By Hannah de Nobrega</p>

                            <p>It is difficult to assess what an expanded Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa
                                (BRICS) grouping will mean for South African trade fortunes and broader economy amid the
                                shifting global power dynamics between North and South, East, and West. However, there are
                                several advantages that could be harnessed, all going well, including improving access to
                                funds, and fostering collaboration across the member countries in developing infrastructure
                                and industrialising.</p>

                            <p>Over the last two decades, global power has shifted from US hegemony to a bipolar dominion
                                between the US and China and then to a multipolar division of power. Several events have
                                accelerated the transition, with the extended membership of BRICS grouping serving as the
                                final nail in the coffin. The BRICS alliance aims to promote and strengthen economic
                                cooperation among member countries while distancing itself from the Western sphere of power.</p>

                            <p>The BRICS alliance has grown significantly, with membership now accounting for 47% of the
                                world’s population and 36% of global GDP. The New Development Bank, led by Dilma Rousseff,
                                is a potentially viable alternative to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
                                (IMF), explicitly curated for BRICS member countries. The de-dollarisation movement, led by
                                Russia, is gaining traction among the BRICS nations and other countries in the Global South.</p>

                            <p>Historically, the BRICS nations have demonstrated the potential for increased intra-BRICS
                                trade due to the complementarity of their export and import products and their low levels of
                                rivalry. The 2008 financial crisis prompted increased collaboration among developing
                                countries, culminating in the formation of the BRICS platform, which has since become an
                                essential component of global governance. Cooperation among the BRICS countries in
                                international finance has fostered a sense of trust among the nations, allowing for a
                                broader scope of collaboration in several other domains. This indicates that there are
                                spillover effects.</p>

                            <p>Argentina and South America have been strategically integrated into the BRICS growth
                                strategy to promote the interests of the Global South. Ethiopia and Egypt are prominent
                                African countries, bolstering Africa’s representation within the BRICS framework and, thus,
                                the continent’s influence. The inclusion of Iran in the BRICS framework demonstrates the
                                group’s willingness to engage with nations involved in conflicts with Western countries,
                                demonstrating their lack of concern about such geopolitical dynamics. The United Arab
                                Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia wield significant economic and geographical power globally.
                                The expansion of the grouping is widely regarded as a significant step towards creating a
                                fair and inclusive global framework that prioritises promoting sustainable development,
                                facilitating economic growth, and implementing necessary reforms within multilateral
                                systems. BRICS also emphasises the importance of peaceful conflict resolution.</p>

                            <p>The expansion of BRICS member countries sparks two debates about South Africa’s future
                                membership in the bloc. To begin with, it is critical to determine whether any of the
                                union’s member countries can effectively replace South Africa as a viable trading partner.
                                In essence, what effect does the increased competition have on the demand for South African
                                goods? Furthermore, are any of the nations that are joining capable of replacing South
                                Africa’s existing commerce? In other words, does adding new member countries reduce market
                                concentration? If this is the case, the potential for South Africa to diversify away from
                                producers who violate human rights will be enhanced due to member nations’ increased desire
                                for free and fair trade.</p>

                            <p>South Africa’s BRICS membership may result in economic imbalance, resource competition,
                                trade imbalances, political and diplomatic differences, limited influence, alignment
                                pressure, reliance on BRICS markets, infrastructure development costs, social inequality,
                                and geopolitical tensions. These challenges require careful consideration and strategic
                                planning to ensure that South Africa’s interests are protected and advanced within the
                                group. The smaller economy and population of South Africa may also limit its ability to
                                shape the group’s agenda and policies.</p>

                            <p>The primary goal of the BRICS cooperation, however, is to facilitate the mobilisation of
                                financial resources for infrastructure development, the promotion of regional value chains,
                                and the enhancement of local production capacities. The South African programme focuses on
                                achieving an egalitarian transition, promoting education, and fostering sustainable
                                development.</p>

                            <p>Despite issues such as unilateralism, geopolitical rivalries, and double standards, the
                                BRICS nations collectively contribute significantly to global growth.</p>

                            <p>As a member of the BRICS group, South Africa can benefit from improved economic cooperation,
                                investment opportunities, geopolitical influence, technology and innovation exchange,
                                infrastructure development, cultural and educational exchanges, and enhanced
                                multilateralism. The major economies of Africa offer appealing investment opportunities, and
                                participation in BRICS projects could improve access to funds and collaboration in
                                developing infrastructure and industrialising. South Africa can also work with other
                                emerging economies to raise awareness about global issues such as climate change, trade
                                disputes, and international governance reforms. The BRICS New Development Bank (NDB)
                                finances infrastructure projects in member countries, addressing infrastructure gaps in
                                South Africa and promoting economic development. Cultural and educational exchanges among
                                the BRICS countries can potentially strengthen people-to-people ties and cultural diplomacy.
                                South Africa, on the other hand, needs to actively participate in BRICS activities, form
                                alliances, and capitalise on the platform to address its own economic and development
                                concerns successfully. The expansion of the BRICS offers significant opportunities for asset
                                managers to earn geopolitical alpha by the strategical diversification of global power
                                across multiple trading channels.</p>
