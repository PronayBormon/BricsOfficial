                            <h3>Brazil: Quo Vadis? Change of Direction or Maintaining International Isolation?</h3>

                            <p>By Charles Pennaforte</p>

                            <p>What can Brazil and the international community expect from the outcome of its presidential
                                election? There is a widespread consensus both in Brazil and abroad that Brazil has suffered
                                great wear in its international image. In the last 30 years Brazil has gone through numerous
                                economic and even political crises, but nothing that threatened the democratic process with
                                possible ruptures of power.</p>

                            <p>However, the election of Jair Bolsonaro in 2018 with a conservative, undemocratic and
                                far-right agenda placed Brazil on the map of international political regression. Of course,
                                Jair Bolsonaro is part of a process that has his exponent in Donald Trump who gave
                                visibility to this conservative agenda.</p>

                            <p>But all that can change.</p>

                            <p>According to the last electoral surveys (August 2022), former President Luiz Inácio “Lula”
                                da Silva, has reemerged into the electoral stage with great force and continues to be the
                                first candidate in the voting intentions.</p>

                            <p> Lula da Silva the same leader of the Workers’ Party (PT) which suffered in 2018 a powerful
                                lawfare action by sectors of the Brazilian Judiciary system, later confirmed by Supremo
                                Tribunal Federal (the Supreme Court of Brazil), by abolishing all his corruption processes
                                involving the former president and his convictions by confirming the partiality of the then
                                federal judge Sergio Moro, leader of the famous “Lava Jato” (Car Washing) Operation.</p>

                            <p>In 2022 Lula aims to victory with an alliance of wide political specter, made of centrist
                                and even the right-wing forces, which are called the “civilized right” because they are
                                antagonistic to the present government. Such a prospect increases his possibilities of
                                triumph.</p>

                            <p>From the internal Brazilian point of view, for most Brazilians -especially the poorest-, the
                                Lula Era (2003–2010) was a period of economic growth, poverty reduction, low unemployment,
                                and prosperity.</p>

                            <p>When he left the presidency, Lula had 80% approval giving him the title of “best president
                                of Brazil” since the beginning of the widespread use of public opinion surveys in the 1990s.
                                That is the memory that millions of Brazilians have of the veteran political leader.</p>

                            <p>The second-place candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, keeps his far-right electorate stagnant in the
                                range of 30% of votes that are insufficient to guarantee victory against Lula in both the
                                first and second electoral rounds (ballotage).</p>

                            <P>The meager economic governance alongside numerous cases of corruption involving family
                                members and political allies, in addition to the terrible management of his negationist
                                government in the covid-19 pandemic that (if not caused), contributed to the death of more
                                than 600 thousand people to date.</P>

                            <P>Except for some major unexpected changes until October 5, the final dispute will take place
                                in the second election round (ballotage).</P>

                            <p>The political groups opposed to the “Polarization” between Lula and Bolsonaro, will try to
                                articulate a “Third Way”. However, the electorate is not much enthusiastic about such
                                proposals. Both Ciro Gomes, candidate of the PDT, and senator Simone Tebet of the MDB — the
                                largest political party in Brazil — aim to present themselves as an alternative to the two
                                best-placed candidates in the surveys. But, they don’t arouse enthusiasm among voters, and
                                both of them will hardly become the “surprise” of this election.</p>

                            <p>The Brazilian elections of 2022 will be the most important since the process of
                                redemocratization started after the end of the Civic-Military Dictatorship (1964–1984).</p>

                           <p> The traditional Brazilian political axis of the dispute between the center-left (PT) and the
                            center-right represented by the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) almost three decades
                            ago was changed to the competition between the center-left (PT) and the far-right led by the
                            Liberal Social Party (PSL) of Jair Bolsonaro. What is at stake is much more than the return
                            of former President Lula to the Planalto Palace, is more like a referendum on his political
                            role in recent years.</p>

                            <p>Brazil lives the possibility of leaving one of the saddest pages since the
                                redemocratization.</p>

                            <p>The country so admired once for its ability to offer solutions that impact positively the
                                world, has become the symbol of contempt for the Environment and Human Rights.</p>

                            <p>In case Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is elected we can visualize Brazil’s return to the
                                international stage with a very different perspective from the current one. Such will imply
                                greater Brazilian proactivity both in Latin America and globally, mainly through the BRICS.
                                A Brazil active in the defense of a multipolar world is undoubtedly the hope for a more
                                balanced and fair international system</p>
