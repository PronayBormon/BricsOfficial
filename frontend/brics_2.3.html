                            <h3>South Africa Chinese Investment Ahead of BRICS Summit</h3>

                            <p>South Africa is seeking more Chinese investments as it struggles with the impact of rolling
                                blackouts and high unemployment.</p>

                            <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to lead a large business delegation to South Africa
                                later next month when he attends the annual summit of the emerging markets group BRICS,
                                which also includes Brazil, India and Russia, in Johannesburg.</p>

                            <p>Fikile Majola, South Africa’s deputy minister of trade and industry, spoke to a business
                                seminar in Beijing via video link, saying the country was looking to improve infrastructure.</p>

                            <p>“Despite South Africa’s success over the years, our country is facing several challenges
                                that need our immediate attention to overcome and I wish to assure you that we are
                                determined to change this situation for the better,” Majola said.</p>

                            <p>“We are well aware that we must prioritise economic infrastructure, especially scaling up
                                renewable energy capacity, roads and railways, ports, and airports, telecommunications and
                                water infrastructure.”</p>

                            <p>The country is struggling to produce enough energy – partly as a result of the breakdown of
                                ageing coal-fired power plants and mismanagement at the state power company Eskom – as well
                                as suffering from the impact of rising food and fuel prices driven by Russia’s war in
                                Ukraine.</p>

                            <p>Last month, the IMF warned that “reforms were urgently needed” to resolve the energy crisis
                                and tackle structural unemployment, which stood at 32.9 per cent, close to an all-time high,
                                in the first quarter of the year.</p>

                            <p>There have been concerns that the country’s public debt levels – the highest among emerging
                                markets – are holding back the government’s ability to respond to shocks and meet growing
                                social and development needs.</p>

                            <p>The crisis deepened last week when hundreds of members of the country’s largest trade union
                                gathered in Johannesburg to demand interest rate cuts, electricity reforms and more jobs.</p>

                            <p>Majola said his country was also looking to use Chinese expertise in fields such as new
                                energy, mining and metal processing.</p>

                            <p>China is the world’s leading clean energy producer, generating 1,213 gigawatts from
                                renewable sources last year, in contrast to South Africa’s total of 10,445 megawatts</p>

                            <p>“Today, South Africa has potential to attract and implement renewable energy projects,”
                                Majola told the event in Beijing. “South Africa’s growing energy requirements provide
                                lucrative investment opportunities across numerous energy value chains.”</p>

                            <p>The country also has the world’s largest reserves of platinum group metals, which play a
                                vital role in hydrogen production and fuel cells for electric vehicles.</p>

                            <p>South Africa launched a national platinum strategy in 2019 which aims to create a million
                                jobs and contribute the equivalent of US$441 billion to South Africa’s economy by 2050.</p>

                            <p>South Africa is China’s largest trading partner in Africa and the launch of the African
                                Continental Free Trade Area – the world’s largest free trade area connecting 1.3 billion
                                people across 55 countries – in 2021 has raised hopes that China can use the country as a
                                springboard to further develop its presence across the continent.</p>

                            <p>Busi Mabuza, chairwoman of the South Africa BRICS Business Council, told the event in
                                Beijing that better cross-border infrastructure was key, adding: “[It is] very, very
                                important to unlock that in order for intra-Africa trade to actually become a reality.</p>

                            <p>“And we believe that in China, we have a partner with the means and the solutions to assist
                                us in getting that cross-border infrastructure on the ground.”</p>

                            <p>Siyabonga Cwele, South Africa’s ambassador to China, said on the sidelines of the Beijing
                                seminar that despite their different political systems, the BRICS member states were united
                                in wanting “a fairer global trading system, fairer representation of developing nations, and
                                more inclusive [global] financial institutions”.</p>

                            <p>Cwele also said the New Development Bank – established by the BRICS states in 2015 to offer
                                alternatives to dollar-denominated lending – is likely to offer proposals for an
                                “alternative currency for international trade” to offset pressures from“unilateral
                                sanctions”.</p>

                            <p>However, Cwele said the currency was designed to provide “alternative financial
                                arrangements” to overcome a range of challenges rather than compete with the US dollar.</p>

                            <p>He added that Western sanctions on Russia are “unilateral sanctions, they are not UN
                                sanctions and these sanctions are affecting us in Africa in a very large way, the food
                                prices, the oil prices and the inflationary pressure we’re all facing”.</p>
