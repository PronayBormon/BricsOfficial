                            <h3>Brazilian Team Releases Outlook Ahead of BRICS Summit</h3>

                            <p>Brazil's Center for International Relations (CEBRI) released a report on the country's
                                expectations regarding its involvement in the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and
                                South
                                Africa) bloc.</p>

                            <p>The document, known as Brazilian Perspectives for BRICS-2022, was released at the
                                invitation
                                of China's embassy in Brasilia and is aimed at mapping trends and strategies ahead of
                                the
                                14th Summit later this month. It was drafted by CEBRI Senior Fellows Tatiana Rosito and
                                José
                                Mario Antunes, with the support of the Asia Center team, and input from dozens of
                                specialists.</p>

                            <p>Brazilian Foreign Ministry's Ana Maria Bierrenbach favors BRICS focused on issues that
                                generate concrete results, and shares with the other partners the defense of
                                multilateralism
                                in pursuit of a fairer and more representative international order and greater
                                participation
                                of developing countries.</p>

                            <p>Bierrenbach, who is the coordinator of Interregional Mechanisms of the Brazilian Foreign
                                Ministry and Brazil's sub-delegate for BRICS, explained that since 2019, when her
                                country
                                hosted the XI Summit in Brasilia, Brazil pursues a BRICS more focused on issues “capable
                                of
                                generating concrete results”, such as economic recovery, overcoming the pandemic, as
                                well as
                                economic and financial cooperation.</p>

                            <p>”We should mention here the New Development Bank (NBD), which is the greatest achievement
                                of
                                BRICS since its creation, and the recently launched vaccine research center, as well as
                                the
                                cooperation agreement on customs facilitation that is ready for signature,“ said
                                Bierrenbach.</p>

                            <p>CEBRI held three meetings this year with Brazilian experts from the private and public
                                sectors and civil society to debate the outlook, where they discussed the strengthening
                                of
                                intra-BRICS trade and investment, strategies to boost the complementarity of supply
                                chains,
                                and stimulate investments to promote productive complementarity and the gravitation of
                                China
                                in the bloc.</p>

                            <p>Bierrenbach also highlighted ”the integration between civil society, the business
                                community
                                and, in particular, the rapprochement between the national business community and the
                                NBD.“</p>

                            <p>”This Brazilian vision, focused on the concrete results of sectoral cooperation, does not
                                neglect the aspect of political coordination, which together with financial [and]
                                economic
                                cooperation and people-to-people contacts make up the three pillars underpinning the
                                BRICS
                                partnership,“ she added.</p>

                            <p>The talks resulted in a declaration adopted by the BRICS foreign ministers' meeting,
                                which
                                was held virtually on May 19.</p>

                            <p>”The negotiations we held for the approval of that document indicate that BRICS continues
                                to
                                be valued by its five members as an important platform for cooperation and dialogue, and
                                that the main objectives that led to the formation of the group 13 years ago are still
                                alive,“ she went on.</p>

                            <p>These goals are ”the defense of multilateralism and the reform of multilateral
                                institutions
                                to make the international order fairer and more effective, legitimately representative
                                and
                                with greater participation of developing countries,“ she further explained.</p>

                            <p>Other relevant issues included ”the promotion of sustainable development, the fight
                                against
                                climate change, and the need to comply with the Sustainable Development Goals and the
                                2030
                                agenda.“</p>

                            <p>”Especially in a scenario in which these goals are threatened by new conflicts and
                                threats
                                that especially impact developing countries,“ Bierrenbach underlined.</p>

                            <p>China's Chargé d'Affaires in Brasilia Jin Hongjun stressed that ”together with Brazil and
                                the other members of the group, the Chinese government hopes to promote a positive
                                outcome
                                for the Summit, making this cooperation mechanism a ballast and a source of energy in a
                                turbulent scenario.“</p>

                            <p>Former Brazilian Ambassador to China Marcos Caramuru de Paiva explained that Brazil will
                                only be able to take advantage of the opportunities opened up by BRICS cooperation if it
                                has
                                a clear vision of a national development strategy. ”Insertion in BRICS and taking
                                advantage
                                of its platform depend on a definition of a broader national strategy. We must not only
                                review some of the big economic issues, but also our insertion in the international
                                economy
                                and find a clearer and more value-added role for the BRICS in our reality.“</p>

                            <p>In this regard, the report points out that Brazil should take advantage of the bloc as an
                                opportunity to diversify and add value to its trade agenda and increase international
                                intra-industry trade, and therefore proposes to stimulate greater engagement between the
                                Eurasian, African and South American continents, where Brazil can build multilateral and
                                regional bridges.</p>

                            <p>At the same time, the five countries are discussing a document proposed by the Chinese
                                presidency on institutional improvements and the promotion of a broader partnership. ”This
                                year, the Chinese presidency broke new ground by holding an unprecedented BRICS plus session
                                in the context of the foreign ministers' meeting, something that had not been done before,“
                                Bierrenbach pointed out. She also underscored that Argentina, Egypt, Indonesia, Kazakhstan,
                                Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, United Arab Emirates and Thailand were to participate as
                                guests.</p>

                            <p>”Brazil supports the BRICS commitment to developing countries and emerging economies, as
                                well as the addition of new members to the NDB, which has already taken place. Brazil is
                                willing to consider criteria for this engagement to be done in a more institutional and
                                permanent way,” Bierrenbach insisted.</p>
