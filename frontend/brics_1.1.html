                                Sergio Duarte</h3>

                            <p>
                                The XV BRICS Summit was held in Johannesburg, South Africa, on August 22-24.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In this regard, PIR Center conducted blitz interviews with the Russian and foreign
                                expert.
                                Dr. Georgy Toloraya, Member of UN Security Council Committee established pursuant to
                                resolution 1718, Executive Director of the National Committee on BRICS; Head of Asian
                                Strategy Center at the Institute of Economics RAS, member of PIR Center Advisory Board
                                since
                                2013, and Ambassador Sergio Duarte, President of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and
                                World Affairs, member of PIR Center Advisory Board since 2022, commented on this agenda.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                - How would you generally evaluate the BRICS Summit held on August 22-24 in
                                Johannesburg?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Georgy Toloraya: We tend to say that summits at a high level, like the one held in
                                Johannesburg, are some historic event, a new milestone, or a new stage of development.
                                The
                                BRICS Summit is indeed a new milestone. The BRICS we knew for almost 15 years is now
                                gone.
                                From that moment on, we will be dealing with a new BRICS. Currently, it is unclear how
                                the
                                new BRICS will operate, how states will interact with each other within the bloc, and
                                what
                                the role of BRICS will be in the international arena. Such a fundamental shift occurred
                                in
                                front of us quite suddenly. This Summit will undoubtedly enter history as a new
                                milestone
                                marking the expansion of BRICS. It is already a huge event, even leaving everything else
                                behind, e.g., the fact that the Summit marked some watershed between the Western blocs
                                and
                                the blocs of the World’s majority and let many states declare their view on the ongoing
                                conflict between the US and its allies with Russia. Even technically, this Summit has
                                appeared to be momentous.
                            </p>

                            <p>Sergion Duarte: The Johannesburg Summit marked a new moment of change in the history of the
                                BRICS due to the support of many countries to the expansion of the group. That decision will
                                enhance the importance and significance of the bloc for world international affairs. It is
                                too early to say what direction the expanded group will take. Yet, I believe it will bring a
                                more innovative and constructive approach toward global security and interstate cooperation
                                issues.</p>

                            <p>- One of the most essential and remarkable outcomes was the expansion of BRICS, with six new
                                countries joining the informal group. How will the expansion of BRICS affect the bloc and
                                the modern international system?</p>

                            <p>Georgy Toloraya: It is worth noting that the issue of the cooperation between BRICS and the
                                World has been discussed lastly within both the negotiation track and among the experts.
                                Thus, on behalf of the Russian National Committee on BRICS Research, which I have been
                                heading since 2011, we have been debating over the agenda within the BRICS Think Tank
                                Council. It has always been evident that exploring new formats for dialogue is necessary.
                                Yet, I have not been in favor of such an expansion. In my view, the process of accepting new
                                members should be gradual. Thus, I once proposed the theory of concentric rings: BRICS+,
                                consisting of the “core”, observing states, states-partners for dialogue, and the BRICS’s
                                Friends Club. There are roughly 60 countries: the first group consists of 5-7, the second
                                includes 10 states, etc. Thus, through participation in various cooperation formats, these
                                states might step-by-step become full-fledged members of the bloc. Nonetheless, in the
                                current unstable geopolitical environment, we have what we have. The BRICS we knew is now
                                gone; a revolutionary change has happened, and it is essential to understand the further
                                steps. The choice of the states joining the bloc is not so evident to me. For instance, I
                                considered inviting and accepting Indonesia indispensable, but it has yet to be ready. In
                                its turn, Ethiopia seems to be on the list accidentally, only as a representative of
                                Sub-Saharan Africa. It is excellent that the BRICS now has Arab states presented, yet Iran,
                                with its harsh relations with the West, can hardly contribute to cooperation between the
                                West and the BRICS, which tends to look for hegemony. Yet, it is worth mentioning that
                                BRICS+ always underscores its inclusive nature and the fact that it does not aspire to
                                confront the West.</p>

                            <p>In fact, the choice of the states joining BRICS results from diplomatic efforts and
                                coincidences, which are not objective. It seems evident that under the same pretext and
                                reasons, other countries will also qualify for membership, and it will be curious if they
                                are not accepted. In particular, if we consider the list of nearly 20 states willing to join
                                the bloc. Some of them will not qualify because of specific reasons. For instance, Turkey is
                                quite controversial. It is a NATO member, but some have recalled Turkey as a nominee. Yet I
                                have yet to hear on that.</p>

                            <p>I am not too fond of the fact that the membership criteria within BRICS are based on today’s
                                conjunctural reasons instead of objective historical reasons. In my view, BRICS is a unity
                                of civilizations and states who are leaders in frames of their region surrounded by many
                                other but closely related historical countries. Such a criterion is objective and
                                transparent. Thus, Arab states are long overdue since the Arab and Muslim worlds have not
                                been presented in BRICS, yet why these particular countries is another question. The newly
                                accepted members, spellbound by the beautiful pictures from summits, lack awareness of how
                                BRICS works and how nearly 200 cooperation tracks within the block established in the last
                                15 years operate. Considering the difficulty of negotiating some solutions and finding a
                                consensus among the initial five BRICS members, I worry that the decision-making process
                                within the bloc will become even more complicated. At the moment, we know each other well.
                                We know who has what to say, realize the states’ views on specific agendas, and know where
                                to compromise and where it is impossible to find common ground. How is it going to happen
                                among 11 countries with no leader? I am still determining what to expect from the newly
                                accepted members and what our work output will look like when we discuss another document on
                                the experts’ track. It is also yet to be evident which expert centers nominated by these
                                states will be able to maintain the dialogue on the same level. The only way now is to wait
                                and observe how it will work further and whether the block will become amorphous, being able
                                to issue the general statements exclusively, with no substance behind the decisions just to
                                please everyone.</p>

                            <p>Sergion Duarte: The new group will probably be further expanded and composed of relatively
                                different countries in size, political and economic power, level of development, and other
                                features. It would be desirable to find a common approach to global governance issues, using
                                the existing institutions and mechanisms to increase cooperation for economic and social
                                development and reduction of inequalities.</p>

                            <p>- Can we assume that the absence of a leader within BRICS and the relative equality of its
                                members facilitate the dialogue and strengthening of interstate relations, or conversely?</p>

                            <p>Georgy Toloraya: The absence of dictatorship, a leader, or even the first among those equal
                                is the primary principle of BRICS, which is why other states aspire to join the block. BRICS
                                is based on mutual respect, consensus-based solutions, and the absence of pressure and
                                hierarchy, which differentiates BRICS from the West. It is worth mentioning that Russia and
                                China are, let us say, progenitors of BRICS, and thus, many ideas within the block are
                                proposed and generated by these two countries. Nonetheless, nobody forces others to comply
                                with someone’s political will. Moreover, bilateral Russia-China consultations on BRICS do
                                not imply any conspiracy or attempts to push their agenda, which is a significant difference
                                between BRICS and Western hierarchical institutions. In this respect, one of the
                                considerable dignity of BRICS is the enhancement of interstate cooperation between the
                                countries that had nearly nothing of a joint interest in the past. I am not sure that
                                Argentina, Ethiopia, and Iran shared close relations in the past, but now they will do so.
                                Based on the Russian example, we collaborate scientifically and practically with Brazil and
                                South Africa more within BRICS than in the past when we did not have the same level of
                                interstate contacts.</p>

                            <p>- In the Johannesburg II Declaration, the states-parties to BRICS paid considerable
                                attention to issues related to maintaining international peace and security, e.g., the
                                conflict in Ukraine alongside crises in Niger and Haiti. Apart from that, the Declaration
                                contains multiple calls for elaborating on legally binding documents and establishing
                                verification mechanisms to observe and ensure the implementation of BTWC, prevent an arms
                                race in outer space, etc. How would you evaluate the BRICS approach and policy towards
                                addressing and resolving security issues?</p>

                            <p>Georgy Toloraya: In this context, it is worth noting that the BRICS point of view is
                                relatively unified and rather unarticulated. Everyone is in favor of non-proliferation, WMD
                                reduction, etc. Here, we instead have to talk about the importance and usefulness of
                                declarative confirmation of these theses at the BRICS level.</p>

                            <p>Sergio Duarte: In the field of international security, I would hope that the new BRICS will
                                give attention to the concept of “human security” by utilizing the possibilities opened by
                                proposals like the United Nations’ Our Common Agenda and by pursuing the implementation of
                                the Sustainable Development Goals, including by observing multilateral commitments, as
                                expressed in the UN Charter and essential treaties. The new BRICS must not adopt
                                antagonistic positions and policies against existing states or groups of states. Its main
                                objective must be to build a more peaceful, just, and predictable environment in harmony and
                                cooperation. Adjustments to some of the institutions of the international system, rather
                                than radical changes, will be necessary to achieve these objectives, which align with the
                                Principles and Objectives of the United Nations.</p>

                            <p>Regarding current conflicts, particularly the one in Ukraine, the BRICS can play a helpful
                                part in bringing the parties to solve their differences, bearing in mind the principle that
                                international disputes cannot be resolved by armed aggression but only through peaceful
                                means. Addressing the legitimate security concerns of all sides involved is imperative to
                                achieve a lasting solution.</p>

                            <p>The new BRICS has a critical role in improving security conditions in the world. It would be
                                desirable that it takes the lead in proposing and taking forward steps toward eliminating
                                nuclear weapons, as well as the cessation of the arms race and the current technological
                                proliferation of new and more deadly arms.</p>

                            <p>- In 2024, Russia will be the chair of BRICS. From your perspective, what the Russian
                                chairmanship will look like, and what are your expectations from the 2024 BRICS Summit in
                                Kazan, Russia? How may the policies of the states-parties to BRICS change by the next
                                meeting of the bloc?</p>

                            <p>Georgy Toloraya: Undoubtedly, it will be a challenge for Russia, which is gathering more
                                states, particularly the newly accepted ones that are yet to understand how BRICS works, how
                                the preparation goes, and how decisions are made within the bloc. It is a tremendous
                                political and organizational challenge that requires much effort and finances, and we must
                                work hard. It is worth noting that we possess enough power and resources to cope with that.
                                Since our relations with the West are at their lowest level, some financial, organizational,
                                and human resources are free. Considering the diversity of the BRICS members we will face
                                next year, I have yet to speculate on the results or novelties. I assume there may be some
                                innovations in the interests of the Global South, the World’s majority; in other words,
                                developing countries. Their respective agenda should be the top priority.</p>

                            <p>For Russia, it is imperative to seek political support from other countries, strengthen
                                national security, and overcome the ongoing military crisis. We certainly require the
                                support of others in this respect. Thus, we will probably need to make concessions
                                concerning the agenda at hand and discuss the issues that are not specifically of our
                                interest but recall the interests of developing countries, e.g., poverty, infections,
                                climate change, and so on.</p>

                            <p>Sergio Duarte: Predicting what the Russian chairmanship will look like next year is
                                complicated. I hope it will use its political influence to direct the group toward promoting
                                peace and security for all states and not only for a few heavily armed ones. The renewed
                                BRICS can play an essential part in taking multilateral efforts forward toward reducing
                                rivalries, achieving progress on nuclear disarmament, and enhancing constructive interaction
                                among nations.</p>

                            <p>- The leading countries are “fighting for Africa” today to maintain and deepen bilateral
                                relations with regional states. Is it fair to conclude that BRICS have already succeeded in
                                this process, and what might be the spheres of mutual interest and long-standing cooperation
                                between BRICS and African countries?</p>

                            <p>Georgy Toloraya: The agenda of the current chairmanship is BRICS and Africa; thus, the
                                African continent has been in the spotlight. Indeed, a tough geopolitical fight for Africa
                                has occurred in the last few years. In this regard, the competition between China and the
                                West is worth mentioning. China has successfully immersed itself in the region, and the West
                                is undoubtedly unhappy with that. In Africa, they do not like the Western colonialists. In
                                this regard, Russia is in favorable conditions. We possess an excellent moral equity, which
                                was laid during the years of the Soviet partnerships with the African countries and our
                                support to them. I have been to many African states, and they always recall Russia
                                excellently.</p>

                            <p>The African arena of action will be dramatic. We can now see the examples of unpredictable
                                events in Niger and Mali, demonstrating that there might be dramatic turns in history. And
                                this is all excluding economic, financial, and moral-political competition.</p>

                            <p>In Africa, like in many other regions, the leader is the one who possesses more financial
                                resources. We cannot say we are winning this competition as the West has enough resources,
                                but our current position differs from the losing one.</p>
