                                        </h5>

                                            The development bank set up by the Brics nations plans to begin lending in
                                            the South African and Brazilian currencies as part of a plan to reduce
                                            reliance on the dollar and promote a more multipolar international financial
                                            system, according to its president.

                                            Dilma Rousseff, the former Brazilian leader who heads the New Development
                                            Bank, also said the Shanghai-based lender was considering applications for
                                            membership from about 15 countries and was likely to approve the admission
                                            of four or five. She declined to name the countries but said it was a
                                            priority for the NDB to diversify its geographic representation.

                                            “We expect to lend between $8bn-$10bn this year,” Rousseff told the
                                            Financial Times in an interview. “Our aim is to reach about 30 per cent of
                                            everything we lend . . . in local currency.”

                                            She said the NDB would issue debt in rand for lending in South Africa and do
                                            “the same thing in Brazil with the real. We’re going to try to either do a
                                            currency swap or issue debt. And also in rupees.” The bank already lends in
                                            renminbi.

                                            The expansion of lending in local currency supports a wider objective agreed
                                            by the Brics nations of encouraging the use of alternatives to the dollar in
                                            trade and financial transactions.

                                            The Brics nations — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — set up
                                            the NDB in 2015 as an alternative to US-dominated financial institutions
                                            such as the IMF and World Bank.

                                            The NDB has lent $33bn for infrastructure and sustainable development
                                            projects and has incorporated non-Brics nations Egypt, Bangladesh and the
                                            United Arab Emirates as additional members, with Uruguay in the final stages
                                            of admission.

                                            Rousseff said lending in local currency would allow borrowers in member
                                            countries to avoid exchange rate risk and variations in US interest rates.
                                            “Local currencies are not alternatives to the dollar,” she said. “They’re
                                            alternatives to a system. So far the system has been unipolar . . . it’s
                                            going to be substituted by a more multipolar system.”

                                            The BRICS countries intend to establish an “AI study group” to track the
                                            growth and development of the technology, according to proposals outlined by

                                            In an effort to make the technologies more secure, dependable, controllable,

                                            What the BRICS Expansion Means to Shipping
                                        </h5>
                                        <p>
                                            In a world where global governance structures are evolving, BRICS’
                                            significance as a potential dominant economic bloc has greatly improved. The
                                            sentiment was better expounded in an address to the BRICS Summit by the UN
                                            Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who said today’s governance structures
                                            reflect yesterday’s world.

                                            “They were largely created in the aftermath of World War II when many
                                            African countries were still ruled by colonial powers and were not even at
                                            the table,” said Guterres.

                                            Indeed, BRICS envisions itself as a united front to emancipate the global
                                            south from a western-led global order. While this ambition is debatable, the
                                            expanded BRICS with the invitation of six new members introduces an
                                            interesting trade dynamic. The new members include Argentina, Egypt,
                                            Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, all of which are top emerging
                                            economies in the world, not to mention their immense geostrategic advantage.

                                            BRICS is still arguably in its formative phases and it would be early to
                                            predict its impact to the global trade and politics. However, with its 11
                                            member countries controlling a combined population of 3.7 billion people and
                                            nearly 70 percent of global oil production, a re-organization of the global
                                            trade patterns could be in the offing.

                                            Most importantly, BRICS pitch for a multipolar world could re-invent
                                            globalized industries, such as shipping. For instance, economic sanctions by
                                            the West against Russia and Iran have created a parallel oil market, as
                                            India and China increased oil imports from the two countries.

                                            This has created what is known as “dark fleet,” comprising of hundreds of
                                            old tankers with murky ownership and shady insurers, playing the role of
                                            moving sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil. An empowered BRICS means Russia
                                            and Iran could more easily evade Western economic sanctions.

                                            In the past decade, China has also sought to influence major decisions
                                            undertaken by key UN bodies. A case in point is a diplomatic campaign that
                                            China conducted ahead of the International Maritime Organization’s MEPC 80
                                            meeting in July. According to a report by the Financial Times, China
                                            circulated a diplomatic note urging developing nations to reject a carbon
                                            tax.

                                            Russia has expressed its interest in collaboration with India in areas such
                                            as quantum technologies and semiconductors, a month after India announced a
                                            joint quantum initiative with the US.

                                            In order to formalise the ongoing conversations between research institutes
                                            and scientists from both the countries on quantum technologies, Russia will
                                            first present a detailed proposal to India for possible collaboration at the
                                            BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) summit next year,
                                            according to people aware of the matter.

                                            Russia will host the BRICS summit next year in Kazan.

                                            “We have great plans for mutual collaborations with India. Next year, we
                                            will discuss it on the platform of BRICS. The collaboration will be around
                                            setting up joint laboratories in cold atoms, 2D materials and
                                            semiconductors,” said Ruslan

                                            “With Russia, we always have had good and trustworthy relationships. We do
                                            not have any official groups yet (with Russia) but hopefully we will have
                                            something soon. Hopefully, both the governments will start something
                                            together,” said Venu Gopal Achanta, director at the CSIR-National Physical
                                            Laboratory, Delhi. Achanta is also working closely with the Indian
                                            government on the National Quantum Mission.

                                            In India, currently research institutes such as Raman Research Institute in
                                            Bengaluru, IIT Madras and government organisations like the Centre for
                                            Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) are working towards the
                                            development of quantum technology in the country.

                                            With regard to the global investments in quantum technologies, currently
                                            China is the leader and has invested about $15 billion, the European Union
                                            invested $7.5 billion and the US about $5 billion.

                                            While India’s quantum mission is at a nascent stage, Russia is working to
                                            provide public access to quantum computers through cloud-based services. The
                                            Russian Quantum Center has developed a quantum simulator, which uses a
                                            classical computer to perform critical tasks and programmes faster with
                                            evolved understanding.

                                            Some of the use cases for quantum simulators are solving logistics problems
                                            as part of which simulators can analyse variables like traffic, weather etc
                                            to suggest efficient routes and faster delivery.

                                            “We are now working on connecting simulators to the cloud for
                                            commercialising the technology so that the industry could use it. At this
                                            stage, we need to first understand what kind of problems this can solve for
                                            the industry,” said Alexey Akimov, principal investigator at Russian Quantum
                                            Center.

                                            The global quantum technology market is expected to reach $42.4 billion by
                                            2027, according to industry estimates.

                                            linked- a happy worker is a productive worker”, she said. She urged BRICS
                                            countries to lead the way in promoting and protecting worker rights by
                                            implementing ILO conventions. So doing, she said, the members’ states should
                                            demonstrate their commitment to a fairer, more equitable society and create
                                            sustainable and inclusive growth conditions.

                                            She further encouraged member states to optimise the relationship between
                                            productivity and decent work, promoting and protecting workers’ rights to
                                            improve poor working conditions, fair wages and protection against health
                                            and safety hazards.

                                            In a message of support from the ILO, Ms Claire Harasty, said labour rights
                                            at work are indispensable in seeking to achieve equality and justice.
                                            “Sustainable enterprise promote good working conditions for employees, and
                                            my organisation is ready to accompany BRICS in achieving its goals.”

                                            African Regional Labour and Administration Centre (ARLAC) representative Dr
                                            Locary Hlabanu said “decent work sums up the totality of the mandate of my
                                            organisation and by extension the ILO. There is need for governments and
                                            social partners to create an enabling environment for social protection”.

                                            The Director General of the Department of Employment and Labour; Mr Thobile
                                            Lamati said the Muldersdrift session paves the way towards the upcoming
                                            technical meetings to be held in May, June and September this year. The
                                            final outcome of these processes will give birth to the declaration to be
                                            adopted by the Ministers and Heads of States.
